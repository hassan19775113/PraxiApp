TITLE: Full Agent System Integration + Dry-Run Validation
DESCRIPTION: Integrate all modules into a coherent system and validate wiring end-to-end via a dry-run script.

FULL PROMPT TEXT:

You are a senior meta-systems engineer.

Task:
Integrate previously built modules into a single coherent agent-driven system, ensuring:
- Workflow DAG is valid
- Artifact/log flow is consistent
- Cloud-Agent wiring is correct
- Developer-Agent wiring is correct
- Self-heal triggers and guardrails are correct
- Fix-agent triggers and best-effort semantics are correct
- Dashboard generation/publishing is wired correctly

Additionally:
- Create a dry-run validation script that checks presence of required files, jobs, and wiring invariants.
- Run the validator locally to confirm it passes.

Output:
- Produce all updated files and a concise summary only.
